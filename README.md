# [496] - An interesting number

This repo is work of mine, a kind of agenda of what I like, what I love and what I recognized as very useful (or just interesting enough) on this path of mine. Hopefully, I will look at this with great pryde later. It shall contain a lot of things from everywhere on the Internet I came accross (but not everything I guess).


It's all public folks.


You can take a look and take what you find interesting and let what you don't think is.
