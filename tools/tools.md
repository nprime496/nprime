# TOOLS

This file show a collection of useful tools for specific tasks. Those tools were added there for a specific reason : their efficience, price or set of functionnalities.
Each tool will have a brief description and a quick summary of their benefits if needed. The sections and subsections division is up to me and doesn't follow any logic else than my thoughts at the moment I created them.


May it be useful to someone.
